This project will use some global variables.
COLOUR represents the current colour being used, and
SIZE is the current size of the paintbrush.

COLOUR = 'black'
SIZE = 10

     A ColourButton is the class for the buttons at the
     top of the screen that change the brush colour.

    This function is called whenever the user is dragging their mouse on the
    canvas. Use the canvas method 'createoval' to draw a circle there.
    Remember to refer to your global variables to draw the correct circle.

def clear_canvas():

#################### MAIN CODE #########################

'''
Here we first are making the ColourButtons. We will do this in a quick
and expandable way using a list. Add all the colours you want buttons for
to the list 'colours'.
The for loop will create the ColourButton objects.
TODO:
- add at least 4 more colours to the colours list
'''

colours = ['red']
for i in range(len(colours)):
    x = ColourButton(colours[i])
    x.Button.grid(row=0, column=i)

'''
Next create the CLEAR button and the width slider.

TODO:
- complete the code fragments below
'''
clear_button = '''# FILL IN'''
clear_button.grid(row = 0, column = i + 1)

SIZE = IntVar()
'''# We are using the global variable as the int var so it is always updated'''
scalebar = '''# Fill in - there are many ways to do this'''
scalebar.grid(row = 0, column = i + 2)

'''
TODO:
- bind the event of mouse button held down while moving ON THE CANVAS to the draw_circle function
- bind the letter q to quitting the program
- mainloop!
